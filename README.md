# mytools - R library

This R library is just a project to make my life easier. I am not a software engineer, just a statistician
who wants to reuse functions that I have programmed in several projects. So please be kind if you catch some
lines of codes which are programmed in a stupid or inefficient way. 

Feel free to use my library. I'm also apreciating sugestions for approvements.

best regards
